      <p>If you hope to become a web developer, you must understand HTML and CSS. HTML is the most used markup language
        across the web, and web developers use it to create web pages on the Internet. CSS, on the other hand, is used
        to style the website. It's responsible for the choice of fonts, colors and layout in a website's design. Whereas
        HTML lays the foundation for a webpage, CSS styles it.As a web developer, you'll need to have keen analytical
        skills to create a variety of successful websites. This involves ensuring the coding is correct so the website
        is functional. Also, it's important to understand the needs of your customers or clients. You'll need to analyze
        their wants and needs and be ready to adapt to any changes they'd like to see implemented on the website. The
        better you understand your client, the better your website will turn out for them in the end.If you work as a
        web developer, it's important to understand how responsive design works. Because many people view webpages both
        online and on their mobile devices, the websites you create need to adapt to the changing screen sizes. If your
        website isn't responsive, this means it won't be compatible with either the desktop site or the mobile site. In
        other words, it won't function or show up properly on either of these platforms. Your ability to create a
        responsive design can also impact the number of visitors a website gets since most people are deterred from a
        website when it's not displaying properly.

      <h2>Develop Without Limits</h2>
      <p>
        As a young child, my dream occupation was to dig up dinosaurs. As I
        grew older and my interests changed, my dream profession changed also.
        Although most of these dreams were not very long lived, one
        occupational dream has outlasted all others, and has finally emerged
        as the dream I passionately pursue.It all started when my grandparents
        purchased their first computer. Being as this was the first computer I
        had ever used, I did not know how to use it very well. I mostly used
        it for games, which my grandma would set up for me to play. I also
        drew pictures with the computer's paint program, the functionality of
        which, unfortunately, was very limited. The relatively new computer
        industry's technology could not produce enough colors to portray very
        realistic pictures. Despite this fact, I spent many contented hours
        creating images on my grandparent's computer.
